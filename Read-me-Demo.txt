# Glow Project

**Glow** is a project that leverages Python's `cv2` library to create custom filters for image processing. The project also includes functionality for extracting image metadata, which can be useful for various applications like image analysis and manipulation. This project is part of a larger portfolio and showcases a range of techniques and tools for image processing.

## Features

- **Image Filters**: Use Python's `cv2` library to apply custom filters to images, enhancing visual appeal or extracting key features.
- **Image Metadata Extraction**: Extract useful metadata such as image dimensions, color formats, and other details.
- **User Interface**: A simple interface to upload and process images with filters and metadata.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for implementing the filters and image processing logic.
- **OpenCV (`cv2`)**: The primary library for image manipulation, including filter creation.
- **Flask** (or **Spring Boot** if applicable): Framework for serving the project as a web application (if integrated into a web interface).
- **JUnit (if applicable)**: Used for testing the functionality (e.g., testing image upload or filter applications).
- **MockMvc / Mockito (if applicable)**: For unit testing the image upload and processing logic (if the project has been integrated with web technologies).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/glow.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd glow
Install dependencies (if applicable for Python projects):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
For Spring Boot projects, you may need to run:

bash
Copy code
mvn install
If using Python with Flask or other web framework, run the web application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
For Spring Boot, run the project with:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Usage
Upload an image to the application through the provided user interface.
Apply different filters to the image using the available options.
View the extracted metadata of the image, including dimensions, file format, and more.
Save or download the processed image.
Testing
If you would like to test the application:

Unit Tests: Tests are written to ensure the functionality of image processing, metadata extraction, and other core features. You can run tests with:
For Python (using pytest):

bash
Copy code
pytest
For Spring Boot:

bash
Copy code
mvn test

### Customization
- **Technologies Used**: You can update this section with the exact technologies you're using (e.g., if you're using Flask for the web interface instead of Spring Boot).
- **Installation & Usage**: Modify the commands based on how users should set up and run your project (e.g., if you're using a virtual environment for Python, you might want to include instructions for setting that up).
